# Ratings and social influence: writeup

Claude writes your answers into the slots below as you say them. You may ask it to change any of
your answers at any time, except the Part 0 predictions. Every `XXXX` in Parts 0 to 5 needs an
answer; the follow-up slots at the end are optional.

## Part 0. Predictions

Answered before anything runs. Claude writes them in as you said them, and they stay as written.

**1. Once people can see the counts, which artist wins most often?** the one that has been downloaded the most by others.

**2. Does inequality rise or fall with social influence?** rise

**3. Does the best artist ever lose a world?** yes

**4. Can a recommender lower inequality without lowering fidelity to true taste?** No

## Part 1. Users on their own

Code: `part1_independent.py`. Figure: `figures/part1_strip.png`.

**What Gini and unpredictability each show, in your own words:** Gini is measuring inequality amoung artists whos the most popular in that world. (popular  = most downloads) Unpredictability shows that the artists popularity is dependent on it's world you can't compare if they arent in the same world

**What the figure shows, one sentence:** It shows that shares of the world depends a lot on the specific world they are in, but the overall true popularity will be high or low on a more general scale (between worlds and in each world specifically)
